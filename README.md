## Installation

Clone git repo and run the following commands

```bash
flutter get packages

flutter run
```

## Usage
User must be inside one of the Hochschule Ulm’s buildings in order to use the navigation feature (although user settings can be modified from anywhere)

The app guides you inside Hochschule Ulm’s hallways. It gets you from any point on the campus to a desired location within the campus by following clear directions visible on your phone after scanning a QR code located at the current location with the inbuilt camera functionality.

Since Navi only needs to scan QR codes with your smartphone’s camera, a powerful device is not required to make full use of the app.
